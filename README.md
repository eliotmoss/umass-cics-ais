UMass Computer and Information Sciences Antarctic Ice Sheet modeling

This will contain a clone of the model(s) developed by Prof. Rob DeConto of
UMass Geosciences and his collaborators.  The goal of the CICS efforts is
to explore ways to improve the precision of the model predictions, running
additional simulations and/or applying machine learning methods.
